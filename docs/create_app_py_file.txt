Once mode training annd tracking via Mlflow is done we finally will use this model for prediction

In order to predict the price of property, the model will required some input information from user
on which model was trained.

To make this possible we created an app using streamlit.

To use the trained model we will need to load the best performing model from mlfow in app.py file

To give user an option while coolecting information from them we will need a dataset. 
so we created the joblib file of data set and load it in app.py file.

Now we have both data and model in app.py file for price prediction of property.

##Note that we can also use FastApi with uvicorn or guvicorn for app creation.

But fot this project streamlit is the perfect option.
