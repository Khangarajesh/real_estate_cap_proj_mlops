we use to deploy our application throgh docker container on github-action-runner's machine like ubuntu-latest 

But problem here was that the runner use to take any randome machine(ubuntu-latest) on cloud, runs the docker file and destroys it
Because of these we could never interact with the application which we have build, cintainerize and ran on random runner.

So to solve this problem we decided to use self hosted machine. 
How to create self-hosted machine ?
1) create EC2 instance  on AWS 
2) connect to that instance through ssh or other way
3) create self-hosted runner on github
4) run the github codes on EC2 instance 

This will create the self hosted runner on EC2

Now you can interact with the application by connecting to EC2 instance using EC2 ip and port number throug web.

{
while using self hosted machine we faced certain issues.

The code which was running perfectly fine with ubuntu-latest suddenly started giving an error while connecting with ECR when replaced with self-hosted machine.
eroor is : Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
 
This was hapening because in aws-actions/amezon-ecr-login repository aws is using --password rather than --password-stdin
this is an issue of aws. we informed aws about this.
}

Another benfit of using self-hosted machine is you do not need to install important and big libraries multiple times
you install them only once.
