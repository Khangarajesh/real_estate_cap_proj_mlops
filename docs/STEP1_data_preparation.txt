For creating an end to end productionize ml model it is important to move from jupyter notebook to vscode and write a code in modular format 
in a well structured way

To do this we prepare the data for training of ml model in different stages in differnt python file and run them all 
sequentially in dvc.yaml file.

following are the stages:

  step_1_FlatsDataset_cleaning
  step_2_Independent_HousesDatset_cleaning
  step_3_merge_flats_and_house
  step_4_data_preprocessing_level_2
  step_5_Feature_Engineering
  step_8_Outlier_Treatment
  step_9_missing_value_imputation
  step_10_feture_selection_and_feature_engineering
  step_11_model_trainig

To create the project in more structure formate we use cookiecutter template 

Using a Cookiecutter template can greatly enhance the structure and organization of your project  

When creating a machine learning project, especially one that involves multiple stages like data cleaning, 
preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, using a Cookiecutter template can help ensure consistency 
and maintainability across your codebase.

This ensures reproduciblity and maintainablity of project.
